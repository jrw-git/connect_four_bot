## Connect 4 Bot for theaigames.com
#### Written in Ruby. Works locally and as a bot for theaigames.com
#### This was my first 'major' ruby project and is not a great example
#### Check my monte_carlo bot for better-organized code
#### https://github.com/jrw-git/monte_carlo_bot

###### This is a text based game/bot. There is no graphical interface.
###### Flaws in this code: No unit testing, poor class separation with players
###### Also could have all interfaces thought out more clearly

### Release 1.0.1: https://github.com/jrw-git/connect_four_bot/releases/latest

### THEAIGAMES INSTALLATION:

More detail to come, but the primary file we want theaigames.com to run is
the "connect_four_bot_parser.rb"

### LOCAL INSTALLATION:

Download the executable from the release page.
