## Connect 4 Bot for theaigames.com
#### Written in Ruby. Works locally and as a bot for theaigames.com

###### This is a text based game/bot. There is no graphical interface.

### Release 1.0.0: https://github.com/jrw-git/connect_four_bot/releases/tag/1.0.0

### THEAIGAMES INSTALLATION:

More detail to come, but the primary file we want theaigames.com to run is
the "connect_four_bot_parser.rb"

### LOCAL INSTALLATION:

To run the game locally, Ruby or JRuby must be installed.

Navigate to the "lib" directory and run "ruby connect_four_engine.rb"

The game will iterate infinitely with the settings you choose at startup

It will log wins/losses/draws/games played in the log file you specify.

### BOT TESTING:

Some of the output from running the connect_four_engine.rb script can be pasted
into a window running the bot script. Namely, anything with "settings",
or "update", or "action". "action move #{somenumber}" prompts the bot to act.
